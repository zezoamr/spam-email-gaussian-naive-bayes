# Spam Email Classification using Naive Bayes Gaussian Classifier

This project uses the Naive Bayes Gaussian classifier to classify emails as spam or not spam. The project is implemented in Python and uses libraries such as numpy, pandas, and nltk.

## Project Description

The project involves the following steps:

1. Reading the email data.
2. Building a vocabulary from the email data.
3. Using the Naive Bayes Gaussian classifier for spam email classification.

The Naive Bayes Gaussian classifier is a probabilistic classifier that makes use of Bayes' Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors. In this project, we assume that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.

## Libraries Used

- numpy: For numerical computations.
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- nltk: For natural language processing tasks.

## How to Run

To run this project, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```
